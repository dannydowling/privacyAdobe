I used NSLookup to evaluate the server resolvers to IP addresses.

This is using someone elses Adobe server list.
It adds rules to the windows firewall and adds to the hosts file.

I'm using Windows Home on a fresh install, I notice it only added 99 firewall rules.
It's a work in progress. No guarantees or anything.
